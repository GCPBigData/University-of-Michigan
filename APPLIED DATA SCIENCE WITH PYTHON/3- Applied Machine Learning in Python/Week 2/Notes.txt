•ridge regression model: Higher alpha means more regularization and simpler models.

Regularization for SVMs: the C parameter
	• The strength of regularization is determined by C
	• Larger values of C & gamma: less regularization
		– Fit the training data as well as possible
		– Each individual data point is important to classify correctly
	• Smaller values of C & gamma: more regularization
		– More tolerant of errors on individual data points
• Typically C and gamma are tuned at the same time.

• The only difference from Ridge regression is that the regularization term is in absolute value.
Lasso method overcomes the disadvantage of Ridge regression by not only punishing high values of the coefficients β but actually setting them to zero if they are not relevant.

• When to use ridge vs lasso regression:
	– Many variables with small/medium sized effects: use ridge.
	– Only a few variables with medium/large effect: use lasso.
